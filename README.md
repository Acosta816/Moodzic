## About
Moodzic is a weather-based music player app. After logging into Spotify from the splash-screen, the user is presented with the home page where he/she simply puts in their current zip-code or city. Afterwards they are presented with their current weather, a couple of recommended cafes or parks depending on the weather, and of course a specially curated music playlist to go with the user's current weather! Please enjoy our app, happy listening!
